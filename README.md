### To-do

 - Handle marker click and show information in a more elegant way than alert.
 - Keep user's decision about the sorting method when requesting new informations to the api.
 - Design better UI for the places list item component.
 - Design better app UI for mobile devices portrait mode.
 - Handle user input errors (like empty address or alpha chars in radius).
 - Handle Google database failures like incomplete vicinities such as "Brazil" or "SÃ£o Paulo".
 - Handle Google api failures like places that don't get returned after you increase radius.
 - Discover if Google's distance rank top varies with radius because it is wrong or because places disappeared.
 - Remove unused code.
 - Add more comments to the code.
